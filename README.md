# Gomoku

A Gomoku (also called Gobang or Five in a Row) AI based on Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-beta pruning written in my first year of university for final project of C Programming course.

It is stupid, I wanted to add heuristic search and some other algorithms, but I started to write it just several days before deadline so there was not enough time...

It is added to a simple command line Gomoku game, you can play with it and have fun.
